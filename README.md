This project is a game made using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) programming language and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework.

This game contains different states like Menu, Game, Setting, End and Quit. These states indicate different pages and design for any game situation.
I am inspired by [Platform Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platformer) such as Little Big Planet, Super Mario Bros, and Cuphead.

The player aims to collect coins and at the same time not hurt for more than 3 times by the traps set around the map.
Player also can access to the setting state to adjust game volume and enable [FPS/ Frame rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate) display.

I decided to make a game for my CS50x Final Project because I am very interested in game development. It is also a great opportunity for me to learn new things, like Lua and LOVE2d. I also learnt exciting things like, game engines, game designs, and game genres during my exploration.
